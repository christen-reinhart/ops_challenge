Additionally, an OpenVPN server will be set up in the VPC to allow access to the management computer.\n\nHere is how the network topology will look:\n\n1. VPC:\n   - Create a VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16\n  \n2. Subnet:\n   - Create a private subnet within the VPC with CIDR block 10.0.1.0/24\n\n3. Internet Gateway:\n   - Attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC to allow outbound internet access\n\n4. Route Tables:\n   - Create a route table for the private subnet and associate it with the subnet\n   - Add a route to the internet gateway to enable internet access from the instances in the subnet\n\n5. EC2 Instances:\n   - Launch the following EC2 instances in the private subnet:\n     - Ubuntu instance\n     - Windows Server instance\n     - Splunk server instance\n     - Windows client instance\n\n6.
