## What is this repo all about?
This repository contains scripts and assignments related to the Ops Challenges and scripting tasks for a class, which cover a variety of IT and scripting topics, including shell scripting, Powershell, system information retrieval, process management, and Windows 10 endpoint configuration.

## Why are you learning these skills?
Learning these skills is essential for individuals pursuing careers in IT, systems administration, and cybersecurity. These skills enable us to automate tasks, manage systems efficiently, troubleshoot issues, and improve overall system security and performance.

## What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
Ops 201 covers fundamental concepts in scripting, automation, system management, and security. Some key concepts include shell scripting, working with arrays, loops, conditionals, system information retrieval, process management, and endpoint configuration.

## What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
My favorite Ops Challenge assignment was the "Automated Endpoint Configuration" using Powershell. This assignment is particularly interesting because it focuses on automating system configuration for Windows 10 endpoints. Automation is a crucial skill, and this assignment offers practical experience in scripting and configuring systems efficiently.

## How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
These examples of shell scripting can be applied in the workplace to streamline various IT and system administration tasks. For example, shell scripts can automate routine backups, monitor system performance, and perform regular maintenance.
